# What is the target
This is mainly targtted at MACOS but the scripts can be used on any OS that allows for exicuting Bash Scripts.
So the scripts can also be ran on Unix, Linux, and Debian and OS's based off these operating systems if bash is installed.

# Automator
Automator is a scripting tool introduced to MACOS in Tiger or MACOS 10.4
This tool allows you to launch scripts at startup.

## To add to startup
Simply export the script as an .app file, they are usually already stored as one.
Copy or move it to the applications folder.
Depending on the version of MACOS you are running
* Older Intel Macs: System Preferences > Users And Groups > Login Items
* Newer M Macs: System Settings > General > Login Items
  
Add the .app file to the Login items
This will run the .app when you login.

# Scripts
These are bash shell scripts
Any OS that has bash shells can run them.
Either run the script using bash or make them exicutable and allow them to run on their own.

By defualt in MACOS it should open and run in the terminal app.
If not, right click > open with > terminal

You can edit the script in a text editor such as VS Code or in the terminal.
